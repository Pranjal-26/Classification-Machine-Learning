# Classification-Machine-Learning
Classification is a process of categorizing a given set of data into classes, It can be performed on both structured or unstructured data.

## KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours) - 
A Customer dataset related to a telecommunication company, clean it, use KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours) to predict the category of customers, and evaluate the accuracy of your model.

## Decision Trees -
This classification algorithm to build a model from historical data of patients, and their respond to different medications. Then use the trained decision tree to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.

## Logistic Regression - 
Create a model with telecommunications data to predict when its customers will leave for a competitor, so that you can take some action to retain the customer. 

## SVM (Support Vector Machines) - 
Use SVM (Support Vector Machines) to build and train a model using human cell records, and classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant.
